===Goals===
 * Cleaner, easier
 * Prettier
 * More trusworthy image
 
 * the "language"-selector is a mess right now. Takes up to much space.

===Goals===
 * Change not to much strings or none at all to keep the old translations.

===Concept===

A concept version of a redesign can be viewed at [http://browser.nabble.nl/].

I started this design a while ago, and adapted it recently to be used at browser-update.org, looking forward to your response!
It radically changes the layout of the current website, and this concept is built with the MVC framework [http://code.google.com/p/ajde Ajde] to better seperate application logic, templates and data (browser definitions). It includes a simple [http://browser.nabble.nl/admin/browser CRUD administrator page] to easily update browser definitions and I plan to further expand it so the widget (browser bar) also uses this centrally stored (MySQL) information.

A major point - in my point of view - is that a lot of text should be changed to represent a more positive approach of trying to convince users to update their browser. What I mean is, not focus on possible security flaws and outdated browsers, but instead on awesome new features and a much faster user experience. This would mean, however, that a lot of already translated strings would be discarded.

This design is largely a rough concept, and a lot of changes are still possible. But I'd like your feedback first, before I continue working on more functionality.

The list of things still to do will continue to grow, but here is a start:

 * Is the current hosting provider capable of MySQL / gettext?
 * Update CSS to be compatible with older browsers (HA HA)
 * Overview of translation strings can be recycled / should be updated
 * Adaptation of current features (blog etc.)
 * Logo redesign?
 * Inline style elements in template
 * New widget look-and-feel
 * Update of update.js (rewrite needed???)
