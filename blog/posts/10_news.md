Its been a long time since the last update here and it may seem like this project is not improving. But we have plenty of updates, changes and achievements to talk about.

* Users: First of all we have over 6000 Websites using the browser-update.org script now. This is a impressive number but we need to reach more webmasters! So spread the word about this campaign. The Google-Hack showed that a secure and up-to-date browser is very important, with even Microsoft now advising to abandon IE 6.
* Translation: We moved to a new (and hopefully easier) translation system using gettext. 
* Customization: Now you can fully customize the notification using CSS and Javascript. This includes text, language, “open link in new window” and even a Javascript callback function.
* New Server: We were moving to a faster server in November, because our old server could not handle the load anymore.
* Future: This year we need to decide if we should move Internet Explorer 7 to the default-list of outdated browsers.
