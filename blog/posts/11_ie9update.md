Internet Explorer 9 has been released today. But it is not available for Windows XP, which has still a significant market share.
Since IE9 is only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7, we have introduced
a message for people using other Systems that they need to choose another browser.

"Internet Explorer 9 - 
Not available for your System. Only for Windows Vista or 7. Please choose another browser."
