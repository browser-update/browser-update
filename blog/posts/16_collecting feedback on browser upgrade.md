title: Collecting Feedback on Browser-Updates

comment: feedback

We implemented a small <a href="/en/update-browser.html">feedback form on the browser update page</a> 
where people can report why they can't or don't want to update.
We are collecting now some data and already got some valuable feedback. 
With this we can improve our notification and the selection of browsers we offer.

<div class="commentimage">
    <img src="/static/img/blog/feedback.png"/>
</div>

For now this only on the english language version of the browser update page.
