We improved the procedure when to show the notification to be even more user-friendly: 
When the user closes or clicks the notification bar, we know that they noticed the notification.
After this we do not show it again for a week, because this means the user has seen the bar 
but has some reason not to update their browser right now. 
Knowing this, we do not want to bother the users, but only remind them some longer time later.


The time interval to the next notification can be changed using the <code>reminderClosed</code> <a href="customize.html">option</a>. 
It defaults to about a week.
