Additionally to the main browsers Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera and Safari we are now
detecting and offering UC Browser(Android), Vivaldi (Windows, MacOS, Linux)<!--, Yandex Browser (Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux)--> and Samsung Internet Browser (Android).

We continue to whitelist a lot small niche browsers in order not to annoy people who choose to use a special browser for whatever reason.
