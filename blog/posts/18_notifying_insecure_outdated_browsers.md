title: Notifying insecure browsers
date: 2018-04-20

The option has been available for a while now: "Also notify all browsers with severe security vulnerabilities". 
However, it was not yet activated in the script.

Now, if the option is set, we also notify browsers that have servery security issues,
such as remote code execution, and if they are being actively exploited.

We hope we can help with this to make the web a safer place and protect users that do not know that their browser is vulnerable.
