For a long time we have ignored mobile Browsers here at browser-update.org on purpose.
They are in particular complicated to detect and on many platforms there is no way to
update the browser without updating the system or even an operating system update is not possible at all.


Now we started to notify users that are using the outdated stock Android browser if they have an upgrade path to another newer browser on their system.
We offer a selection of up-to-date browsers for Android to them, currently consisting of Chrome, Firefox and Opera.


We investigate including more browsers as choices to update and to notify other mobile platforms like Windows Phone and maybe iOS in the future.
