Many webdesigners using browser-update.org have told us that we should move Internet 
Explorer 7 to the outdated Browsers since the release of IE9 last year.


Users now get warnings when they still use Internet Explorer 7 which was released 
more than 5 years ago in October 2006.


IE 7 currently approximately holds a global market share of less than 3%.


The default outdated browser list is now:


* Internet Explorer 7 or older (released Oct 2006, market share ≈< 3%)</li>
* Firefox 3.6  or older (released Jul 2010, not supported with security updates anymore, ≈< 3%)</li>
* Opera 10.6 or older (released Jan 2010, not supported with security updates anymore, ≈< 0.1%)</li>
* Safari 4.0 or older (released Feb 2009, not supported with security updates anymore, ≈<0.2%)</li>


IE7 is after IE6 the browser webdesigners are struggling  the most with when creating their
sites. It supports almost none of the HTML5/CSS3 features and speed improvements of current browsers.
An interesting approach to get users to update their browser was chosen by an Australian online shop: 
They added an <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5918599/australian-electronics-retailer-shame+taxes-customers-who-use-internet-explorer-7-updated">additional tax for users of IE7</a>
to pay their webdevelopers for optimizing the site for this ancient browser.
