Microsoft has also realized the problem about outdated browsers - at least regarding their fossil, Internet Explorer 6.
They created the site <a href="http://www.ie6countdown.com/">"The Internet Explorer 6 Countdown"</a> with the subtitle
"Moving the world off Internet Explorer 6".
Nice to see them join us in the fight.
We, <a href="http://browser-update.org">browser-update.org</a>, already have convinced
about 300&nbsp;000 users to move off Internet Explorer 6!
