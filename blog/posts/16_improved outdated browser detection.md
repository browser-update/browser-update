We now check for more browsers if they are up-to-date: Yandex Browser, Pale Moon Browser, and Vivaldi Browser.


The detection script was slimmed down more and we improved detection of Microsoft Edge.


When creating your update-notification code for your site you have now a few new options:


* You can choose to notifiy browsers that have been outdated for e.g. 3 months instead of specifying a certain browsers versions. This is now the default for Chrome, Firefox and Opera.
* You can choose wheather to notify users with outdated mobile browsers.
* You can choose to generally notify all browsers versions which are not supported by the vendor anymore.
* You can choose to notify all browsers with security vulnerabilities.
