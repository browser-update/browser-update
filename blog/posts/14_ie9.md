Internet Explorer 9 was released in March 2011, almost four ago. We will now start 
to notify users of this browser (in the default configuration).


We changed the code you have to include in your site. It is a little bit smaller and faster.


In our continuing quest to inform the majority of relevant browser and not to erroneously bother users of small
browsers we whitelisted a few small browsers (CoolNovo,Blackberry 10,PaleMoon, QupZilla), which will not get the notification.
