We improved the detection of browsers in combination with the Operatin System a User has (Android, Windows, MacOS, Linux) and the Version of the Operating System.


We keep track which browsers are available for which Operating system.


If there is now browser available anymore for the system we hint the user to update their system and link to a site explaining this.


Also some browsers (Safari, Microsoft Edge) can only be updated together with the system. Here we tell the user to choose another browser or update their system.
