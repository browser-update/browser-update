title: Rebuilt with python
date: 2018-05-07

Since translating into some languages did magically not work and we hunted the bug 
for hours to days in php and gettext we finally took the step we wanted to do for a long time: 
rewrite the site in python. It is now built using python with flask and much more cleaner and easier to maintain.

Along this major effort hundreds of small improvements were made to the browser-update.org site and the build toolchain.
