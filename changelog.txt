3.0.0 20.4.18
Big rewrite:
- excessive tests
- $bu_get_browser() now returns an object with a lot of information around the browser:
   - if it is insecure
   - if it is still updated
   - years since release
   - the rendering eingine
  - if it is on mobile
  - if the underlying operating system can be updated if the browser updates are limited by the os (like e.g. on iOs, very old macs, or very old windows systems)
- semantic version comparison
- Option to not shift the page down when the bar is shown on top
- new (backwards compatible) html layout of the message that can be customized more flexible
- the bar can now be permanently hidden to be more friendly to users that can for some reason not update their browser (for now until translations flow in only for english)
- by default the browser-update page now opens in https (except for IE, which in old versions might not work)
- the message text is now modular in order to show different messages for browsers with severe security issues
- now notifying severely insecure versions if insecure: true is configured
- now notifying unsupported versions if unsupported: true is configured

2.3.3 19.4.18
